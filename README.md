The data was pulled from Whitepages.com using a pre-defined list of search terms related to the Grateful Dead. It must be noted this is not an exhaustive list of Grateful Dead-named businesses in the United States, and many of these businesses may have closed since 2012. Any reuse of this data should include this caveat in the analysis and write-up.
